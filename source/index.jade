          | The web enables us to make software that reaches and connects
          | everyone. But the best minds of our generation are thinking about how
          | to make people click ads. That sucks. Are we working on the right
          | things? This talk tells the story of the Code for Tulsa brigade, and
          | why you can use web development to make your city, our state, and
          | maybe our world a better place.

          | I will be describing in detail why organizing and preparing your
          | team and project for when it gets large is an obvious win over the
          | lifetime of a web application. Specifically talking about how
          | spending some time and effort considering the long term implications
          | of up front design and tooling decisions will result in a better
          | organized and easily maintained project as it gets MASSIVE!  I'll go
          | into detail about tools, processes, can best practices that will help
          | make the project scalable and maintainable.  There will be a section
          | that is specific to Angular applications taking about 1/3 of the
          | available time.

          | Using build tools and public git repositories allow developers to
          | create for and distribute our work to...other developers. But what
          | about artists and writers and other non-developers who don't know how
          | to open terminal, let alone run `npm install`? I'm going to talk
          | about how I entered this problem space by building a drawing app and
          | learning how to document and distribute code in a way that people of
          | all technical and non-technical backgrounds can enjoy it.

          h3 Mobile Applications with Javascript and Ionic
          h4 Josh Bavari
        p
          | Theres two things I am absolutely passionate about:
          br
          br
          | 1) Cordova for mobile applications
          br
          | 2) JavaScript
          br
          br
          | Using the Javascript framework Ionic built on top of Cordova, it's
          | easy to make slick mobile applications built with web technologies.
          | Ionic is built with several components from AngularJS, is open
          | source, and has an ever growing user base with forums. Lets embrace
          | JavaScript and make apps that are capable of running on your mobile
          | phone through an app or a web browser.

          h4 Tracy Hinds
        p
          | Twitter flame wars.
          | Open source project failures through contributor fallout.
          | Bullying that leads to the bullying of bullies.
          br
          br
          | How do we maintain our communities? How do we grow them? How is
          | anyone in their right mind stepping into the caustic social media
          | environment of programming we have created for ourselves?
          br
          br
          | There are steps we can take with user groups, conferences, online
          | worlds that can help support an inclusive environment that allows
          | for debate, learning, growing, and excitement. The social sciences
          | have 100 years of research that can provide us with tools to
          | treat our fellow programmers with care. Much of this has been
          | battle-tested in the organizations we run. The bubbles we live
          | in. Let's share how we're creating a better world that is
          | welcoming to programmers, new and experienced, so that we're
          | leading by example. 
          br
          br
          | Your words are powerful, and  <em>“actions speak louder than words, but
          | not nearly as often.”</em>

          h3 Supercharge Your Productivity with Ember.js
          h4 Jeremy Green
        p
          | Ember is an opinionated application framework.  Like many
          | opinionated frameworks things get much easier when you learn what
          | those opinions are, and why they are in place. This session will
          | bring you up to speed on the concepts represented by all of the major
          | parts of the framework, and you'll be well on your way to quickly
          | delivering highly interactive applications.
          br
          br
          | MVC is a popular pattern used in both server side and client side frameworks.
          | Unfortunately due to the differences in focus, some of the common words and
          | phrases can become overloaded and confused.  This session will dive into the
          | specific parts of server and client side MVC patterns, comparing and
          | contrasting each part of the system.  Code examples will be in Ruby on Rails
          | for the server, and Ember.js for the client, but the concepts will be broadly
          | applicable to other languages.

          h3 Better Living through Control Flow Graph Generation
          h4 Chris Dickenson
        p
          | This talk will be an introduction to the data structures and phases
          | involved in parsing (tokenization, abstract syntax trees, control
          | flow graph generation), and what useful tools can be built on the
          | various derived formats of your code. The overarching theme is that
          | dealing with your code on a different level of abstraction gives you
          | superpowers. This talk will include information about control flow
          | graphs + doing code review, static analysis, and optimization with
          | that intermediate format.

          h3 NodeBots Wearables: JavaScripting Your Wardrobe
          h4 Kassandra
        p
          | As NodeBots platforms get more and more diverse, they're also
          | getting smaller and easier to build and program. This talk explores
          | crafting wearable tech using sensors, outputs, and all written in JS.
          | This includes sewing together robotics pieces, dealing with stray
          | wires, and other wearables-specific challenges.

          h3 So tell me again why we're not using node.js?
          h4 Jordan Rousseau
        p
          | Two years ago at WDT, the technology solution for any web
          | application was LAMP. My breaking point was us investigating Zend PHP
          | to expand our application capabilities. I was over it, we knew
          | JavaScript and there was a great new (but a bit unstable) platform
          | out that was starting to make some noise. It was time to make a
          | change.
          br
          br
          | I went through struggles with management, other developers and most definitely
          | myself on whether or not node.js was the right technology (spoiler alert, it
          | might not be).
          br
          br
          | I want to share my experiences and tips on how to make the decision if node is
          | right for your company and how to convince others (and especially yourself)
          | that node will work and it's not really going out on a limb.

          h3 The Importance of Building Developer Communities
          h4 Jennifer Wadella
        p
          | Today, companies are competing for technology talent more than for
          | business. As a developer, you have more power than you may realize.
          | You have the power to shape our technology landscape and build the
          | kind of companies for which you want to work (and not just by
          | founding them). Google doesn’t hold the monopoly on developer culture
          | nor does Silicon Valley hold the monopoly on job opportunities in
          | innovation. Learn how as a developer at any level of the corporate
          | ladder you can make an impact in your company, and Kansas City,
          | through building developer communities.

            | Democratizing Hardware
          h4 Chris Williams
        p
          | With the rise of widely available chipsets, open source hardware
          | components, and makerspaces, the only thing holding back the coming
          | Hardware Revolution is... the arcane languages needed to program
          | them. While most of the development industry has pushed forward into
          | far more accessible and expressive languages, the domain of hardware
          | has been stuck in the 1980's. With the rise of NodeBots, which
          | started as node.js robots but is now inclusive of all languages, the
          | trend toward making hardware hacking accessible to all has grown
          | stronger and broader. 
          br
          br
          | As a gatekeeper between the two worlds, due to being the author of
          | node-serialport, I have been witness to this amazing trend and would like to
          | invite you to join us as we bring robots, copters, boats, and rockets, but most
          | importantly the maker movement to all software and web developers.
